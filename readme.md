# Time Series Analysis and Anomaly Detection

A collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring various time series analysis techniques and anomaly detection methods.

## Overview

This repository contains notebooks that demonstrate different approaches to time series analysis and anomaly detection. Each notebook focuses on specific techniques and methodologies for analyzing temporal data.

## Notebooks

### 1. Anomaly Detection
Time series analysis and anomaly detection project for the Petrignano Aquifer system. Analyzes groundwater levels, rainfall, temperature, and hydrometry data to identify patterns and anomalies. Features data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling for environmental monitoring.
